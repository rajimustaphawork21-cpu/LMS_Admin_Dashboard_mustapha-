It looks like `vite` is not being found, which suggests that the project dependencies might not be fully or correctly installed. This can happen if the `node_modules` folder was not completely removed or if `pnpm install` didn't finish properly.

Please confirm that you have manually **stopped all related processes**, **deleted the `node_modules` folder**, and **deleted the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file** as instructed previously.

Once you confirm these manual steps are done, I will re-run `pnpm install` and then attempt `pnpm dev` again.
